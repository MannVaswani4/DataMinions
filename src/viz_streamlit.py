Streamlit Visualization Module
===============================
Interactive web-based visualizations using Streamlit.

TODO: Implement Streamlit dashboard when ready, such as:
- Interactive maps showing air quality by location
- Time series charts for trends
- Comparative analysis between countries
- Filtering and drill-down capabilities

Example structure:
```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

def main():
    st.title("Air Quality Dashboard")

    # Load data
    df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_data/analysis_ready.csv')

    # Create visualizations
    # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
"""

# Placeholder for future Streamlit visualizations
