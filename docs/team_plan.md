- **Focus**: Setting up data pipeline, initial preprocessing, repository structure

### Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6): Exploratory Analysis & Visualization
- **Project Lead**: Priya Patel
- **Focus**: EDA, visualization dashboards, pattern identification

### Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9): Modeling & Hypothesis Testing
- **Project Lead**: Rohan Kumar
- **Focus**: Building predictive models, statistical testing, validation

### Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12): Final Report & Presentation
- **Project Lead**: Ananya Singh

## Collaboration Tools

### Version Control
- **GitHub Repository**: [DataMinions](https://github.com/team/DataMinions)
- **Branch Strategy**: 
  - `main` - stable, reviewed code only
  - `dev` - active development branch
  - Feature branches: `feature/data-fetch`, `feature/eda`, etc.
- **Commit Convention**: `[TYPE] Brief description` (e.g., `[FEAT] Add preprocessing pipeline`, `[FIX] Handle missing values`)

### Project Management
- **Notion Workspace**: Used for task tracking, meeting notes, and progress documentation
- **Google Sheets**: Shared for dataset inventory, hypothesis tracking, and result logging

### Communication
- **Slack Channel**: #dataminions-project for daily updates and quick questions
- **Weekly Meetings**: Every Monday 6:00 PM (1 hour) for sprint planning and progress review

---

## Contribution Guidelines

### Expected Contributions Per Member
- **Minimum 2 commits per week** with meaningful changes
- Each member must contribute to at least **2 different aspects** of the project (e.g., code + documentation)
- Code reviews required before merging to `main` branch

### Commit Tracking
All team members commit using their individual GitHub accounts to ensure proper attribution and evaluation scoring.
